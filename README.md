Car Models

Use Python to build a console app that interacts with two files:

car-makes
car-models
Car Makes

This file should contain just the names of several makes.

car-makes

Toyota
Nissan
...
Car Models

This file should contain the names of several models for each make. The format will be as follows.

{first letter of make}={model name}
car-models

T=Camry
N=Altima
...
Requirements

Create a single class that implements all functionality.
Create a method for reading the car makes file.
Create a method for reading the car models file.
Create a method that invokes the previous two methods and generates a dictionary.
The dictionary keys will be the make names.
The value for each key will be a list of model names.
{
    "Toyota": ["Camry"],
    ...
}
